# Visual Sort
### Wesley Miller

A personal project to get a better understanding of different sorting algorithms 
and start learning how to make React apps.

Run `npm start` to start the local development server.

Note: due to an issue with npm and `react-scripts`, `npm audit` will flag false vulnerabilities. 
Use `npm audit --production` instead. `react-scripts` is only a dev dependency, so this isn't
a concern at the moment.
